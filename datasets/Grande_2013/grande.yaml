notes: "The ms does not have a DOI, but it has an ISBN: ISBN:978-3-89937-159-8. The data blocks in this dataset were inferred with reference to the readme text associated with the dataset on dryad. Codon positions in each coding gene may not correspond with each other (i.e. '1' is not necessarily 1st codon position)."
