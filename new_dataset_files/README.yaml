study:
    reference:  [reference taken from Google Scholar, in the VANCOUVER style when you find the paper and press 'cite']
    year: [year of publication, as an integer]
    DOI: [URL for the paper starting doi.org, check and double check that this points to the right study]

dataset:
    DOI: [must be a URL for the dataset, starting doi.org, which is different from 'study' DOI, check and double check that this points to the right dataset]
    license: [should always == "CC0" or "CCBY", usually Dryad datasets are CC0, and FigShare are CCBY, but you have to know for sure]
    figshare: [valid URL to figshare version of the dataset in our repository]
    dataset_curation:
        alignment_file: [A file path in unix format. which alignment file do I use from the repo linked in the doi. give a file path e.g. alignments/nt-mt.phy] 
        partition_information: [A file path or notes about where the partition information is, or how it was obtained. E.g. "alignments/nt-mt-gene-partitioning.txt, each partition was assumed to be in frame 1; this was checked by eye"]
        justification: [Why use this alignment file? E.g. "This is the alignment used to produce figure x in the paper"]
        sequence_edits: [Describe any changes made to the alignment, e.g. "removed taxon "Test123" because it was not in the tree in figure x of the paper"
    used for tree inference:
        concatenated: ['yes' or 'no']
        locus_trees: ['yes' or 'no']
    timetree:
        timetree species 1: [species name added to Taxon 1 box on timetree.org]
        timetree species 2: [species name added to Taxon 2 box on timetree.org]
        date accessed: [date timetree used]
        timetree root age: ['NA' or an integer followed by 'mya' (millions of year ago); get this from timetree.org, as the median age of the root of your tree]
        timetree lower CI: [lower CI from timetree followed by 'mya'
        timetree upper CI: [upper CI from timetree followed by 'mya'
        timetree N: [number of studies used to get time stats, from timetree.org]
    study root age: ['NA' or an integer followed by 'mya' (millions of year ago), if the estimated age of the clade of interest is mentioned in the study itself, put it here]
    study clade:
        latin:  [A single word in latin that describes the smallest clade of organisms that includes all those in the current study]
        english: [One or more words]
        taxon ID: [a GenBank Taxon ID by searching here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=, which should be an integer that resolves without a 404 when you add it to the end of this URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=, e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=27563]
    outgroups: [the outgroup taxa names, seperated by comma]
    notes: ['NA', or some text. Anything important not covered by the sections above, that a user should know about]
