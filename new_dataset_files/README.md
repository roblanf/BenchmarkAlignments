How to add a dataset
====================

What you need
-------------

1. A DNA, amino acid, morphology, or language alignment from a published paper.

2. A DOI for the dataset, where the dataset is already archived with a CC0 license (this is critical)

3. Lots of additional information on the alignment, including:

    (i) Where the partitions AND the physical loci are

    (ii) Which genome (mitochondrial, nuclear, chloroplast) each partition comes from

    (iii) Codon positions (for protein-coding DNA datasets)

    (iv) Ages of sequences (e.g. for aDNA or virus datasets)


What you do
-----------

1. Convert your alignment to NEXUS format. The format should be identical to that in Anderson_2013, this is not flexible or negotiable. See below for precise details on how to format this file.

2. Add a SETS block to the .nex file with four comments [partitions], [loci], [genomes], [outgroups].

3. Add CHARSETS that describe each partition in the [partitions] section, according to the conventions below. Every site in the alignment needs to be covered by one and only one of these CHARSETS.

4. Add CHARSETS that describe each genome of origin to the [genomes] section, according to the conventions below. Every site in the alignment needs to be covered by one and only one of these CHARSETS.

5. Define outgroups such that the tree can be rooted. You will need to carefully read the original paper to do this. 

6. If you have heterochronous data, create a SAMPLINGDATES block, and populate it with the sampling dates of all taxa (see Duchene_2015a for an example).

7. Check and double check the nexus file. Check it loads into IQ-TREE and RAxML.

7. Make a new folder in the /datasets folder

8. Name it after the first author and year of publication (e.g. Brown_2012)

9. Copy the README.yaml into the folder. Fill in ALL fields.

10. Add in the dataset itself, in NEXUS format, and named alignment.nex

Running tests and updating the database
---------------------------------------

Once your new dataset is in, you need to test the database (including the new dataset), calculate summaries, and update the `summary.csv` file. You will need python 2.7.x and python 3.x. Python scripts are all in the 'python' folder.

1. `python check_files.py`. Use Python 2.7.x to check all of the files in your repository, including the new dataset you added. This will run a comprehensive set of tests on all datasets, including checking all of the alignment formats, yaml files, DOI links, etc.

2. `python generate_summaries.py`. Use python 3.x to generate summaries of any new datasets (uses AMAS.py, which is included in the repository).

3. `python generate_csv.py`. Use python 3.x to generate the summary.csv file.  

On my system, this invovles the following (2.7.x is my default, and I use Conda to manage environments)

```
python check_files.py
source activate snakes
python generate_summaries.py
python generate_csv.py
```

Upload to figshare
------------------

1. `python gzip_datasets.py` to zip up the datasets
2. Add any new .tar.gz files to: https://figshare.com/s/622e9e0a156e5233944b


Conventions
-----------
Follow all of these rules...

1. Your NEXUS file should start with these two blocks: DATA and SETS.

2. It may also contain a SAMPLINGDATES block.

3. The DATA block should look like this:

        begin DATA;
            dimensions ntax=145 nchar=3037;
            format datatype=nucleotide missing=? gap=-;

The datatype must be either 'nucleotide' or 'protein'. The missing and gap symbols must be as above.

4. Your 'SETS' block should look like this before you put the data in:

```
    begin sets;

        [partitions]

        [loci]

        [genomes]

        [outgroups]

    end;
```

5. Inside the 'sets' block, we are aiming for something like this:

```
begin SETS;

	[partitions]
	CHARSET	COI_1stpos = 1-1592\3;
	CHARSET	COI_2ndpos = 2-1592\3;
	CHARSET	COI_3rdpos = 3-1592\3;
	CHARSET	16S = 1593-3037;

    CHARPARTITION partitions =  1:COI_1stpos,
							    2:COI_2ndpos,
							    3:COI_3rdpos,
							    4:16S;

    [loci]
    CHARPARTITION loci =    1:COI_1stpos COI_2ndpos COI_3rdpos,
                            2:16S;

	[genomes]
    CHARPARTITION genomes = mitochondrial_genome: COI_1stpos COI_2ndpos COI_3rdpos 16S;

	[outgroups]
	TAXSET outgroups = Afrololigo_mercatoris_FEA Alloteuthis_africana_312327;

end;
```

6. ALL protein coding genes must have their codon positions delineated. We use the format above, which is e.g. NAME_1stpos. Where "NAME" is the name of the gene. Every gene must have all three positions defined.

7. Check that each protein coding gene really is in the frame you think it should be (and that you have indicated in the nexus file). Do this in geneious by translating it and checking the translation by BLASTing the sequence against GenBank and checking the official translation.

8. Add information to the genomes section, to make sure that every single base is covered by one of the following annotations:

    mitochondrial_genome
    nuclear_genome
    chloroplast_genome
    dsDNA_genome
    ssDNA_genome
    dsRNA_genome
    ssRNA_genome

The latter four are reserved for viruses

9. If the data is heterochronous (i.e. sampled from multiple time points) make sure that you include a 'SAMPLINGDATES' block. Here's an example:

        begin SAMPLINGDATES;
        	dimensions ntax=12;
        	units = calendaryears
        	FJ174401, 1978
        	KC990883, 2012
        	FJ174385, 1961
        	GQ477151, 2007
        	HM745325, 2009
        	HM745346, 2005
        	JX857503, 2009
        	HM745344, 2005
        	HM745350, 2005
        	FJ174397, 1988
        	FJ174412, 1993
        	HM745343, 2005
        end;

10. In the README.yaml file, fill out everything as instructed in the file itself. Don't change the structure of the yaml file, or delete any entries.

11. Fill in the CHARPARTITIONS. Make sure that each CHARPARTITION covers every single base (yes, every single one) in the alignment. There are three
